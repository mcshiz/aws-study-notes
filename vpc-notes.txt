VERY VERY IMPORTANT
think of VPC as virtaul data center in the cloud
create virtual network of AWS services
security groups or NACLS
can create VPN connection from office to aws data center
1 AZ per subnet 
1 internet gateway per VPC
NACL block specifc IP's
security group can span subnets and az's

default vpc is setup by amazon upon account creation and defualt to have internet access

must have 1 nat gateway per AZ

1 subnet -> 1 az -> 1 nacl

one to many acl to subnet
NACL are stateless
	stateless means you have to open it up for inbound and outbound
Subnets are stateful
	stateful means if you open an inbound port outbound will automatically be opened too

Load Balancers MUST be placed into two internet facing subnet groups across multiple azs
