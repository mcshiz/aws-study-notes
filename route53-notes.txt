 Alias records map naked domain to elb
 ELB does not have pre defined ipv4
 Alias records do not have associated charge but cname does
 in exam questions pretty much always choose alias over cname
does not belong to region is a global policy
POLICY TYPES
 Simple - 1 webserver - user -> route53 -> webserver 
 weighted - user -> route53 -> 20% to server A, 80% to server B (A/B testing) - split traffic based on different weights assigned
 latency - route based on lowest latency for user 
 failover - have servers in two regions, if health check fails in primary region it will send 
 traffic to secondary region - requires you to setup healthcheck in route53
 geolocation - route traffic based on geolocation of users (euro users go to euro servers, good for showing euros vs dollars, different languages etc..)


EXAM TIPS
 ELB never have ipv4 just DNS
 alias vs cname
 	alias can resolve to different aws resources
 By default one account can only have 50 domain names
