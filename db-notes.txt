OLTP vs OLAP
transaction processing vs analytics processing (expensive queries)

Elasticache (top 10 products on your website)
memcached or redis
used to relieve DB of frequent queries

RDS - OLTP
 SQL
 MySQl
 Postgres
 oracle
 aurora
 maria
DynamoDB - nosql
Redshift - datawarehouse - OLAP
Elasticache - in memory cache

Mysql port 3306
encryption not available in t2 micro

for ec2 to connect to mysql must allow access in the security group

two tpyes of backups
	automated - full daily snapshot (point in time recover) - enabled by default - free storage in s3
	snapshots - user initiated wont be deleted when RDS instance is deleted

restoring from backup will create new DB endpoint
backups are encrypted if encryption is turned on
cannot turn on encryption after instance is started

MULTI AZ - exact copy
syncs everything from RDS in az 1 to RDS in az 2
for disaster recovery only
6TB max RDS volume size
No charge for replicating data to secondary RDS instance
Read replica
spread load across multiple RDS
provide read only copy of production DB
not available for SQL or oracle
must have auto backups turned on
can have up to 5 read replicas
can be promoted to their own DB (will break read replication)
can be provisioned across AZ's

DynamoDB only know at highlevel for SA exam
nosql db
very low latency
stored on SSD
spread across 3 difference data centers
 eventual consisten reads - consistency of data reached w/i 1 second (faster read after write)
 strongly consistent reads - waits for data to be propagated across all data centers
priced by writes and reads and storage used
Push button scaling (easier to scale than RDS)

Redshift - Datawarehouse
 single node max size 160gb
 organizes data by columns
 compared to RDS fewer i/o and better query performace
 better compression than RDS
 automatic compression
 priced based on compute node hours, backup, vpc
 everythng is encrypted
 only available in 1az

Elasticache
 cache popular queries in memory (reduce load off DB)
 Memcached and Redis

Aurora - probably wont be on exam just yet
 5x better performance that mysql
 starts with 10g, scales in 10g increments up to 64tb
 highly redundant
